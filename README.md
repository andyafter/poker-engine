# Poker AI: Building a Pluribus-like Bot

This repository contains code and resources for building a poker AI inspired by Pluribus, the AI developed by Facebook AI Research and Carnegie Mellon University.

## Overview

Pluribus is a state-of-the-art AI that has achieved superhuman performance in six-player no-limit Texas Hold'em poker. It uses a combination of techniques including Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR), abstraction, and real-time search to compute its strategy.

Our goal is to build an AI that uses similar techniques to play poker. This is a challenging task that involves a deep understanding of both poker strategy and advanced AI algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the poker AI.
- `data/`: This directory contains any data used by the AI, such as precomputed strategies or training data.
- `docs/`: This directory contains documentation for the project.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poker-ai.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd poker-ai`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the poker AI, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
